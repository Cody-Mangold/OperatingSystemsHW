Collaboration:

Collaborated with victoria martinez. (small). Just received help with debugging my part2 values.



Correctness:

I believe I did everything right to my current knowledge. 

Comments:

Ran into some issues with the LRU implementation, wasn't updating the reference count enough so I was getting random values.


output:

prints out the number of pagefaults found in part2.c when it is run.

both part1 and part2 will print an error message and return -1 if there are not enough parameters, I.E an input and output file.
